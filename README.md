# My Investment Thesis

If you're reading this it's probably because I've asked you for investment advice. I combined all my thoughts, including notes taken our conversations, into this series of documents. I made this document for my use, but it may be valuable to you as well.

## What can you find here?

This contains a lay person's research and reasoning towards investments that:

- have reasonable yields for our current negative interest rate environment
- are significant inflation hedges, or
- are asymmetric bets (big upside, small downside)

It takes into account living in the Philippines and abiding to Philippine tax law. However, this should, for most part, be applicable to other citizens.

I've approached you for advice regarding traditional investments that yield interest, but because some of you might be interested, I will touch what I have invested in as well (namely bitcoin).

This is a work in progress, and will be updated as I learn more. You may find sections that are incomplete. Those are sections where I have to dig into more in order to put something sensible.

## What amount am I looking to invest?
The kind of of advice you give depends on the amounts a person is looking to invest. This document will contain investment vehicles that are applicable, but not limited to, investments from $10,000 to $5,000,000+.

## What are my amounts?
I have an amount that I have put to work now. I have found places to lend this money that return from 4% to 8% per annum.

As you know, I also have bitcoin. If bitcoin follows its pattern, and there is no guarantee that it will, then by mid to end of 2021 it will reach a new high. The reason I have approached you is in case this occurs, I don't want to be caught asleep on the wheel. I intend to sell a portion of what I have and put that money to work. If bitcoin does not shoot up again, the knowledge I learn here will still be put to use, though it will play out over a longer timeframe.

## Investing

Investing is basically:

1. Theory explains behaviour of an instrument
2. Backtesting must support #1
3. Magic when #1 and #2 play out

This is solid advice I have gotten from one of you, but this write up will not include quantitive data.

### High Dividend Yield (VYM)

![YVM from 2007 to 2020](images/vym.png)

Investing in VYM in 2007 before the Great Financial Crisis, would still have allowed $3M to grow to $10.4M in 2020, excluding the yield, which would have given you $90k per year in 2007 and $310k per year in 2020.

You may invest in [this](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VYM) via [Saxo in Singapore](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg), which has the benefit of not paying taxes on profits until profits are brought back into the Philippines.

### World Total Return (VT)

Also [available](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) via Vanguard.

### Corporate Bonds

Ayala, among other large corporations, offer corporate bonds. These currency yield 8% per year for a $200k investment.

Questions:
- What are the tax implications, since this is a Philippine instrument? Probably subject to 20% capital gains tax.

### Bitcoin

Though bitcoin is a non-yielding asset, in the world of negative interest rates and central bank policies of flooding the economy with money, having a hard-capped supply (only 21 million bitcoins will exist, ever), immutable, global (fairly liquid in many markets), and decentralized (no one controls it, censorship-resistant) store of value is increasingly being perceived as an insurance policy against inflation (or credit deflation if you will).

I'm bullish on bitcoin in the short term, and and in the long term. I owe you an explanation here, and I will put it on a [separate document](bitcoin.md).

### Gold

Gold is the original hedge against inflation, and has been recommended to me for some of the same reasons bitcoin is increasingly attractive. My concerns with gold are:

- verifiability
- third-party risk

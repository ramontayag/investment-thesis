# My Investment Thesis

If you're reading this it's probably because I've asked you for investment advice and sent you what I've learned so far with the rest of the advice given to me.

This contains a lay person's research and reasoning towards a specific investment plan. It is geared towards living in the Philippines and abiding to Philippine tax law. This should, for most part, be applicable to other citizens.

## What amount am I looking to invest?
The kind of of advice you give depends on the amounts a person is looking to invest. This document will contain investment vehicles that are applicable, but not limited to, investments from $100,000 to $5,000,000.

## What are my amounts?
I have an amount that I have put to work now. I have found places to lend this money that reeturn from 4% to 8% per annum.

As you know, I also have bitcoin. If bitcoin follows its pattern, and there is no guarantee that it will, then by mid to end of 2021 it will reach a new high. The reason I have approached you is in case this occurs, I don't want to be caught sleeping. I intend to sell a portion of what I have and put that money to work. I will have a plan. If bitcoin does not shoot up again, the knowledge I learn here will still be put to use but in a longer time frame.

- Amount - now and future
- What is the goal?
- Even if future money doesn't come, knowledge gained here will help me with current money
- What do you want to do with your existing money?
- What is an asymmetric bet?

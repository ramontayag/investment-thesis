# Bitcoin

When I first discovered (and subsequently ignored for a year) Bitcoin in 2011, I asked myself "what is money?". This question led me down a rabbit hole.

I will explain why I'm interested in Bitcoin and then list down sources where you can learn more. Due to the numerous excellent articles, books, and essays I've read over the years, rather than cover all points of view, I figured it is better to list them down along with the target audience.

# Why I'm Interested

Bitcoin led me down the rabbit hole of money. My questions around it were first about its technology, but the deeper I went the more I questioned what money is, its origins, and its importance to societies. Money affects things more than I ever imagined.

Money affects how we plan for the future - as individuals or as actors of the state (a.k.a government employees plotting the country's financial future). If money is cheap or even free to make more of, we tend to do just that. Today, due to cheap money, we have record high debt levels from individuals, to companies, and countries.

Ray Dalio has the best video I've seen explaining the [economic machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0): debt is money we borrow from out future selves, and this causes us to have to tighten our our belts in the future and contract our spending, causing boom and bust cycles. He delves into details in [Big Debt Crises](https://www.principles.com/big-debt-crises/), explaining how this happens time and again.

Central bank manipulation of money, by taking on debt, becomes less and less effective especially if the debt is never fully paid off. In other words, if debt keeps piling on, becoming a larger and larger part of a country's GDP, then the more fiscal stimulation -- QE or whatever you want to call it -- needs to occur to have the similar effects. At some point, the economy will overdose on debt in the form of inflation, credit deflation, and/or stagflation.

# Empires & Money

Money contributes to the rise and fall of empires. Those in power have almost always inflated the money supply until its collapse. This has been a recurring theme throughout history, from coin clipping to what we see today, which is the press of a button to manipulate 1's and 0's.

With today's form of money printing, which is through debt, official (CPI) inflation is negligible, then it is bearable, then for its finale, inflation leaves you in the dust. Inflation is correlated with the fall of empires.

Even if there is no hyperinflation as in Weimar Republic and Zumbabwe, the use of debt to simulate the economy will eventually cause the economy to be in a vegetative state, like Japan.

As always, there are some people that see the writing on the wall, and these people move to a better form of money. This is Gresham's Law, in effect. It is this movement we're seeing today: people are moving to a better form of money fit for our modern times.

# Is the world interested?

Will people move to bitcoin? They are. Will the central banks of the world have bitcoin in their balance sheets like they have gold? I do not know.

In one respect, I doubt it. They will likely create a version of [Bancor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor) for the 21st century, because they want to be in control of the money supply and continue their mission on this earth.

However, Bitcoin is a grassroots movement, and government is made up of individuals. The iPhone in the enterprise was a grassroots movement as well. It worked because the individuals insisted on owning them personally, and then brought them into the workplace. Though Apple didn't have enterprise contracts like Blackberry did, where is Blackberry today? If a significant portion of people in government own bitcoin and the people own bitcoin as well, thus causing a good part of the economic transactions occurring in bitcoin, then would central banks start adding it to their balance sheets?

Even if bitcoin stays a grassroots movement, it will have a non-zero role in when there's another currency collapse / reserve currency regime change.

"It's too risky" is a common response. Shouldn't risk be managed by allocating a smaller amount? If your financial advisor tells you to stay away from Bitcoin, they are either too lazy to learn more about it, or do not know how to manage risk & reward. It has been the best performing asset of the last decade. 0% allocation is the wrong answer.

# Bitcoin as Money

I think Bitcoin is the most likely winner for a grassroots chosen money because it scores well for the qualities of money.

- Verifiable. Verifying bitcoin is much easier to verify gold. You can verify it with a smartphone.
- Fungible. A bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin.
- Portable. I can memorize my wealth in my head and cross borders. You can send it to anyone with an internet connection. It is being used for remittances especially in recipient countries with unreliable financial systems.
- Durable. Bitcoin is information, and information cannot be destroyed. You may lose your private keys, but creating a plan to keep these safe, though not easy, is far easier than storing a closet of gold bricks.
- Divisible. A bitcoin can be infinitely subdivided into smaller and smaller parts.
- Scarce. Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist. Today, there are about 36 million $ millionaires. Each of them couldn't even buy 1 bitcoin, even if they wanted to.
- Censorship resistant. You only need an internet connection to send bitcoin. You do not need anyone's permission. You do not need to submit identifying documents to hold it. Those that know how have side-stepped the authoritarian capital controls in countries like Venezuela and Argentina, notorious for the current currency collapse.
- Counterfeit-proof.
  - You can't create a fake bitcoin.
  - It is also trivially easy to prove of reserves: you can be mathematically prove certain of the bitcoins they held in a bank and have a control over. If [rehypthecation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp) is part of the business model, you can know for certain what amount institutions have in custody.

Furthermore, Bitcoin is the only relatively liquid asset that's globally available and tradable 24/7. It is the only one you can truly own without relying on a armed force to [protect your property rights](https://medium.com/@hasufly/bitcoin-and-the-promise-of-independent-property-rights-8f10e5c7efa8). Due to these, it will be a perfect asset for large settlements -- something that a reserve currency is primarily used for.

Although I can go further, the thoughts I have in my head are years' worth and are also mostly gleaned from the different things I've read over the years.
